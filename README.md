# Sentiment Analysis of the Debate 2023 - 2

In this project, I used various tools and technologies to analyze the sentiment of speeches delivered during a the debate that took place in 2023.

For this project I used
- WhisperX to convert approximately 2 hours of spoken content from the debate into text format.
- Pysentimiento, a sentiment analysis library tailored for the Spanish language.
- Pandas, for data processing, cleaning, and organization.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot data.
